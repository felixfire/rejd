Welcome to ReJD Documentation
===============================

ReJD (Representation JSON Data) - Python library that change your "JSON like" data representation.

The small library will help you pull data from an input object using JSONPath and
generate new objects according to a schema.

JSONPath is like XPath (XML) for JSON.
To learn the syntax, read the documentation for the `original article <http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/>`_ by Stefan Goessner.

Below you can learn how to build an effective schema to transform your data.
